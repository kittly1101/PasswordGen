# SO, WHAT'S THIS?
This is a password generator project so I can learn Python, and it's being shared so if anyone else likes it then they can have it. Enjoy!

# WHAT DOES IT DO?
It, uh, generates passwords. Here:

```
./passwordgen
     _________
    / ======= \
   / __________\
  | ___________ |
  | | -       | |
  | |         | |
  | |_________| |________________________
  \=____________/                        )
  / """"""""""" \                       /
 / ::::::::::::: \                  =D-'
(_________________)'

Generated password:
U(pGFkVC-RD2#i
```
