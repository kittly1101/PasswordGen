# SO, WHAT'S THIS?
This is a password generator project so I can learn Python, and it's being shared so if anyone else likes it then they can have it. Enjoy!

# WHAT DOES IT DO?
It, uh, generates passwords. Here:

```
./passwordgen
password
U(pGFkVC-RD2#i
```
# WHAT'S NEXT?
I am currently working to resolve all the issues I've filed. If you find any, please submit a pull request or file an issue and I'll........eventually get it. Maybe.
